# Version 0.1.1
- Fixed error caused by TMB no longer exporting summary.sdreport


# Version 0.1.0
- Added movement models: Random Walk (rw) and Multiple Persistence Continuous Time Correlated Random Walk (mpctcrw)
- New residual types (besided the old ”smooth”): Smooth predictions (”smoothpred”), Simulated residuals (”simulated”), and one step residuals (”onestep”)
- Possibility of using multiple $log(\beta)$ parameters over time
- Added type=”map” to plot.argostrack to include background map in plot of estimated track


# Version 0.0.2
- First official release, submitted to Ecology
- Implemented Continuous Time Correlated Random Walk (ctcrw) with normal/t distributed measurement errors
- Function to simulate from the ctcrw based on a model fit.
- Function to get smoothed residuals
- Function to bootstrap the model based on a model fit
